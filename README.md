# R General Use User Guides

These guides provide raw code examples for getting started with bioinformatic operations in R. 

They cover a range of topics:

- Getting started with Github - Introduction to GitHub Version Control

- Getting started with R/RStudio - Introduction to R programming language and how to get set up - we recommend reading this first!

- R Cheat Sheet - A useful collection of code that can be copied in order to perform a variety of basic operations in R such as importing data.

- Basic Dplyr - An introduction to one of the most widely used methods for data manipulation in R inlcuding: cleaning, transforming, and summarising data.

- Introduction to ggplot2 - This is the go to package for data visualisation and used to create most graphs and charts

- Heatmaps in heatmap.2 - This is one of the many heatmap packages available and is particuarly useful for visualising morphometric data from InCarta

- UMAPS in R - Introduction to dimensionality reduction with UMAP, which is often used for visualising multi-parameter single target data

- TNSE in R - Introduction to dimensionality reduction with TSNE, which is often used for visualising multi-parameter single target data

**Guides for following this code (along with the raw data) are available on the facility Teams Hub in the "04 - Bioinformatics Script Repository" folder or can be downloaded from the "Walkthrough Guides" folder and opened in your web browser.**
