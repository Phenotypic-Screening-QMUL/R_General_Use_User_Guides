# R General Use User Guides

These guides provides code examples for getting started with bioinformatic operations in R. 

They cover a range of topics:

1. R Cheat Sheet - A useful collection of code that can be copied in order to perform a variety of basic operations in R such as importing data.

3. Basic Dplyr - An introduction to one of the most widely used methods for data manipulation in R inlcuding: cleaning, transforming, and summarising data.

4. Introduction to ggplot2 - This is the go to package for data visualisation and used to create most graphs and charts

5. Heatmaps in heatmap.2 - This is one of the many heatmap packages available and is particuarly useful for visualising morphometric data from InCarta

6. UMAPS in R - Introduction to dimensionality reduction with UMAP, which is often used for visualising multi-parameter single target data

7. TNSE in R - Introduction to dimensionality reduction with TSNE, which is often used for visualising multi-parameter single target data

More specific code examples for individual analysis software may be found in the facility GitHub and Teams Hub. 

If you would like to copy the scripts only - these are available in the Raw Code folder
